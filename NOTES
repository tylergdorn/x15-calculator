These are my notes and assumptions for the project:

1. I am using JDK 11
2. I am using Gradle 5.4.1.
3. I am using JUnit 4.12
4. I assume that expressions should be evaluated left to right, as the math in the example seems to imply
5. I assume that the you can't reference variables ahead of time as I could imagine you could do. i.e:
            a = b + 1;
            b = 4;
            result = a + b;
6. I assume that the there are no extra lines on the top or bottom of the script
7. I assume that the regex \(1-9)(0-9)+\ should actually be \(1-9)(0-9)*\, as the former means you could not have one number values, which contradicts the example.
8. I assume that "result = ...;" expression is treated as a normal variable, and does not immediately end the script.
    8a. in addition I assume that variables can be reassigned, as result could. I imagine that you might want something like this:
            a = 1;
            b = 2;
            result = a + b;
            b = result + 1;
            result = b * 2;
    where the result would be 8, which would be printed at the end of reading the whole script.
9. the expression can contain extra spaces, but style dictates that you shouldn't have extra spaces
