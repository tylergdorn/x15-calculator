These are my notes and assumptions for the project:

1. I am using JDK 11
2. I am using Gradle 5.4.1, and not the wrapper for gradle, to adhere to the instructions
3. I assume that expressions should be evaluated left to right, as the math in the example seems to imply
4. I assume that the you can't reference variables ahead of time as I could imagine you could do in a sane way. i.e:
            a = b + 1;
            b = 4;
            result = a + b;
5. I assume that the there are no extra lines, i.e. that the result should always be the last line of the "program" and the first line should be the first statement(or result).
6. I assume that the regex \(1-9)(0-9)+\ should actually be \(1-9)(0-9)*\, as the former means you could not have one number values, which contradicts the example.
