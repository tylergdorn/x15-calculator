These are my notes and assumptions for the project:

1. I am using JDK 11
2. I am using Gradle 5.4.1, and not the wrapper for gradle, to adhere to the instructions
3. I assume that expressions should be evaluated left to right, as the math in the example seems to imply
4. I assume that the you can't reference variables ahead of time as I could imagine you could do in a sane way. i.e:
            a = b + 1;
            b = 4;
            result = a + b;
